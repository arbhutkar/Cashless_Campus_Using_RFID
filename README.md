# Cashless_Using_Transactions_RFID
The RFID-based Cashless Transaction System is designed to facilitate secure and seamless transactions using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. The system works as follows:

⿡ User Registration: Each user (student, employee, or customer) is issued an RFID card that is linked to their account in the database. The card contains a unique ID associated with the user’s balance.

⿢ Tapping the RFID Card: When a user wants to make a purchase (e.g., in a cafeteria or store), they tap their RFID card on an RFID reader. The reader captures the unique ID and sends it to the backend system.

⿣ Transaction Processing: The backend system verifies the user’s identity and checks the available balance in the linked account. If sufficient funds are available, the transaction is approved, and the amount is deducted from the balance.

⿤ Database Update: After the transaction, the updated balance is stored in the database, and the user receives a confirmation of the successful payment.

⿥ Security & Authentication: To enhance security, encryption techniques can be used to protect RFID data. Additionally, users may be required to authenticate transactions using a PIN or biometric verification.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java

Database: MySQL for storing user details and transaction records

Hardware: RFID cards, RFID readers

Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the admin portal to monitor transactions)

This system helps eliminate the need for cash, making transactions faster, safer, and more efficient, especially in closed environments like schools, colleges, and workplaces.
